# name: exchange reaction
# def: "A modeling process to provide matter influx or efflux to a model, for example to replenish a metabolic network with raw materials (eg carbon / energy sources). Such reactions are conceptual, created solely for modeling purposes, and do not have a physical correspondence. Exchange reactions, often represented as 'R_EX_', can operate in the negative (uptake) direction or positive (secretion) direction. By convention, a negative flux through an exchange reaction represents uptake of the corresponding metabolite, and a positive flux represent discharge."

# id: SBO:0000628
# name: demand reaction
# def: "A modeling process analogous to exchange reaction, but which operates upon \"internal\" metabolites. Metabolites that are consumed by these reactions are assumed to be used in intra-cellular processes that are not part of the model. Demand reactions, often represented 'R_DM_', can also deliver metabolites (from intra-cellular processes that are not considered in the model).

# id: SBO:0000632
# name: sink reaction
# def: "A modeling process to provide matter influx or efflux to a model, for example to replenish a metabolic network with raw materials (eg carbon / energy sources). Such reactions are conceptual, created solely for modeling purposes, and do not have a physical correspondence. Unlike the analogous demand (SBO:....) reactions, which are usually designated as irreversible, sink reactions always represent a reversible uptake/secretion processes, and act as a metabolite source with no cost to the cell. Sink reactions, also referred to as R_SINK_, are generally used for compounds that are metabolized by the cell but are produced by non-metabolic, un-modeled cellular processes."
